# Subjective-Objective-Sentence-Classification-Using-Word-Vectors-and-NLP
This project contains three models trained to classify whether a sentence is subjective or objective.
The three models use simple statistics, CNN, and RNN respectively.
To try it out, just download the models and subjective_bot.py, then run it.

This is a course project, the course is MIE324 at University of Toronto. If you are a student of this course and find this project is similar to one of the projects you got (although I don't think this project will be used again), please contact me and I will make this project to be private. Thank you!
